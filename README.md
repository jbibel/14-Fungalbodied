# 14-Fungalbodied

My contribution to Patricia Taxxon's upcoming colabrative music video for her track "Ordeal Day" from the album <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szsvBK3_-As">Wavetable</a>.

Made with <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> and <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">tone.js</a>.

A note: the three sliders are leftover from a previous project. They effect the amount of visualization if you do end up fiddling around with them. Also, this uses 1,800 images and is poorly optimized so it will most likely run like shit.
